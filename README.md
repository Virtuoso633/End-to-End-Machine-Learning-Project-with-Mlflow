## Workflows




# Purpose: This file typically contains configuration settings for your application or project.
# Action: Modify config.yaml to adjust settings related to paths, environment variables, or other configuration parameters needed by your application.
1. Update config.yaml 


# Purpose: The schema file defines the structure of your data, including the columns and their types.
# Action: Ensure that schema.yaml accurately reflects the structure of the data you're working with. Update it as needed to match any changes in your data schema
2. Update schema.yaml



# Purpose: This file holds parameters for various components of your project. It allows users to modify parameters without changing the code directly.
# Action: Update params.yaml to ensure that it includes all necessary parameters and reflects any changes or new parameters introduced.
3. Update params.yaml


# Purpose: Entities represent data structures or objects in your project.
# Action: Modify or add entities as needed to reflect changes in your data or requirements.
4. Update the entity


# Purpose: The configuration manager handles the loading and management of configuration files like config.yaml, schema.yaml, and params.yaml.
# Action: Update the configuration manager to ensure it properly loads and applies changes from the updated configuration files.
5. Update the configuration manager in src config


# Purpose: Components are the various modules or functions in your project, such as data ingestion, validation, and processing.
# Action: Make necessary updates to the components to accommodate changes in configuration, schema, or parameters.
6. Update the components


# Purpose: The pipeline integrates all components and handles the workflow for tasks like training and prediction.
# Action: Ensure that the pipeline is updated to incorporate changes in components and configuration. This might include updating the training and prediction processes
7. Update the pipeline


# Purpose: main.py typically serves as the entry point for your application or project.
# Action: Update main.py to reflect changes in the pipeline, components, or any new functionality.
8. Update the main.py


# Purpose: app.py handles the user interface or application logic that interacts with users.
# Action: Modify app.py to integrate any new features, configurations, or changes made in the previous steps. Ensure that the UI reflects the latest updates.
9. Update the app.py
